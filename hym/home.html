<h1>About HYM</h1>
<h2>Creating and unlocking value for our investors while improving communities.
<h2>
<p>The HYM Investment Group, LLC is a Boston based real estate company that focuses on the acquisition, development and management of complicated mixed-use urban projects with major residential, commercial and retail components. HYM and its principals have a long and successful track record in planning, permitting, financing, constructing and managing complicated mixed-use developments in both Boston and Cambridge. HYM&#39;s success is directly related to the expertise and skill of its professionals and to HYM&#39;s comprehensive neighborhood process, which engages all stakeholders including landowners, local businesses, municipal departments, state agencies and elected officials. HYM is currently active on four major projects in the Boston and Cambridge areas that encompass over 9 million square feet of development.</p>

<p>For over 35 years, HYM&#39;s principals have been working on real estate ventures in the Boston, New York and Washington, DC corridor. HYM has broad and strong working relationships with elected city officials, city staff, and neighborhood organizations in Boston, Cambridge and Somerville as well as the State of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and other key agencies. We have a proven history of securing difficult to obtain permits and approvals from Boston, Cambridge and Somerville due to HYM&#39;s thorough and inclusive public process with all stakeholders, as evidenced by the unanimous city approvals of both the Redevelopment of the Government Center Garage (Boston) and the NorthPoint (Cambridge).</p>

<p>HYM has extensive experience developing projects with institutional investors including National Real Estate Advisors, Britannia Pacific Properties / The Lewis Trust Group, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citizens Bank, New Balance, Prudential, Canyon Johnson Urban Funds and GE Capital.
