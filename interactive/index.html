<p>So lots of people were tweeting at me today wishing me a happy Presidents' Day and seemingly shocked that I was working today. They thought it should be a day of rest for titans of industry like myself. A day to appreciate and reflect on all my success and wealth. To reap the rewards of 15 years of hard work that led to me being the President of a multinational blogging organization.</p>

<p>Well if you thought I&#39;d take today off you don&#39;t know me very well. Today of all days is the day I need to work the hardest. The day I need to set an example for my team. To be the first guy in the gym, last guy out. Never quit. Never slow down. Be a dog. To show that working on Presidents&#39; Day is exactly how I became a President. But even I was unprepared for just how much I&#39;d be tested today. Because when I showed up to the office we were locked out. Poor Blind Mike just sitting in the streets helplessly freezing his blind ass off. The landlord apparently changed the locks without telling us. It would have been so easy just to pack it up and call it a day.To relax and take the holiday day off. But what did I do? Did I cave to temptation? Did I give in?  Did I cry? Nope. I called a locksmith. Never surrender. Never say die. Even when the locksmith somehow locked himself inside our office I didn&#39;t blink. I never thought about leaving him to fend for himself. I was determined to find a solution and get cracking. I knew the rundown needed me. I don&#39;t care if most of middle class America isn&#39;t working today. There are no days off when you want to be the best. That&#39;s what Presidents&#39; Day means to me. I&#39;m not looking for congratulatory handshakes or the spotlight. I&#39;m just looking to tell people you get what you earn and you don&#39;t become a President by taking it easy on Presidents&#39; Day. I&#39;m living proof of that. God bless hard work. God bless me.  #GoPresGo</p>

<h1>Compatibility</h1>
My site is compatible in a few different browers which is great. The transitions are compatible on chrome, safari and firefox.<br/> I looked the site up on my phone however and the transitions stopped working. The site layout was also altered slightly but<br/>  that is understandable due to the fact that I do not yet know how to code a website for mobile formats.
